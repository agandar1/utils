# utils
This is my library of general Common Lisp utility functions and macros.
I have accumulated these nice utilities over time as I've needed to write them.
Many of them are my own, and others I've found in one place or another. 
Particularly, many of the fancy macros are from the book On Lisp, which I've been reading.
